# Sound_Classifier

In this module, we have created a speech recognition (or keyword detection) system using EDGE IMPULSE. In this project, we will start with a simple, pre-made dataset, add our own target sound, and build a classifier for those sounds. I used google speech commands dataset to create my project
My goal is to get familiar with the words Go and Stop.
