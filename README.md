# Sound_Classifier

In this module, we have created a speech recognition (or keyword detection) system using EDGE IMPULSE. In this project, we will start with a simple, pre-made dataset, and build a classifier for those sounds. I used google speech commands dataset to create my project(we also can add our own target sound)
My goal is to get familiar with the words Go and Stop.
